# How to Install Windows 11

**IMPORTANT!** These instructions are written to completely delete any data on the system that you're going to install Windows on. The instructions may vary from model to model, as you may have to go into your system's BIOS to ensure you can boot from a USB device.

You will need a USB Drive that is 8 GB or larger.

## Step 1: Create a Bootable Windows Installation USB Drive

This first step has to occur on an existing Windows system. Insert the USB Drive (which will be deleted!) into the system.

* [Download the Windows 11 Media Creation Tool](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2156295) to the desktop
* Run the program from the desktop
* When it prompts you, select the USB Drive from the dropdown
* It will take about 20 minutes to create the drive

## Step 2: Start the Windows 11 Installation

* You'll want to make sure the computer doesn't have an internet connection during installation, if possible. Unplug any USB WiFi devices and ethernet cables before installing, or you won't be able to create a local administrator account.
* Insert the USB Drive into the system where you are installing Windows 11.
* **IMPORTANT!** This will wipe all data on this system!
* Turn on the computer and wait for a few minutes while the Windows 11 setup boots from the USB Drive.
    * If it doesn't boot to the Windows 11 setup, you'll need to figure out how to make the system boot from the USB drive. The varies by system, and Google will be your friend here to figure out how to make your system boot to USB.
* Choose your languages and keyboard layout, and click `NEXT`.
* Click `INSTALL NOW`. It'll take a minute for setup to start.
* Check the checkbox to accept the terms, then click `NEXT`.
* Click `CUSTOM`.
* You will see the drive partitions on your hard drive, perhaps only one. Select each one and click DELETE. **IMPORTANT!** This is the step that will delete all data on the computer.
* After you have deleted the partitions, you should see only one entry, which says, `Drive 0 Unallocated Space`. Select it, then click `NEXT`.
* Installation will now start and take about 20 minutes, depending on the speed of your drives. The system will reboot itself; when the system reboot, you can remove the USB Flash Drive.

## Step 3: After Reboot

* Select your country or region (defaults to US) and click `YES`.
* Select your keyboard layout (defaults to US) and click `YES`.
* You can add a second keyboard, or most likely click `SKIP`.
* Click `I Don't Have Internet`, even it is isn't true; we want to create a local account.
* Click `Continue With Limited Setup`
* Enter the name of the primary user of the computer, click `NEXT`. The local account will be an Administrator with full rights to this computer.
* Enter a password for the primary user (or leave it blank). Click `NEXT`.
* Turn off the options for `Diagnostic Data`, `Inking & Typing`, `Tailored Experiences`, and `Advertising ID`. Click `ACCEPT`.
* Setup will continue for a few minutes, then you'll be all set to go!
